Asphyxiate: You bend the air out of your target’s lungs and create an air bubble around their head so air cannot enter as an action. The target must make a constitution saving throw against your save DC with disadvantage even if they hold their breath unless they have some sort of advanced breathing ability. If they fail, their hit points drop to 0. If they are resuscitated, they have 3 levels of exhaustion. On a successful saving throw, they take 10d12 necrotic damage and take on 3 levels of exhaustion. This spell does not work if the target does not need to breathe. If you spend 11 additional chi points, you can target another creature with this technique in the same action.
